### Game

There are many games in this project (four-up, liars dice, etc). Each game has:

- a unique id

- the name of that game

### Match

A match refers to an instance of a game. You can retrieve a list of matches by
typing:

GET /games/<game-name>/matches

### Player

A player is a person who signs up on the website. A player has:

- a unique id

- a username

- a friendly name

- a url for match invitations. If you'd just like to accept all invitations, set
this url to (some URL we have hosted on our site).

- a url for match moves

### Move

A move is an individual move during a match. The move schema depends on the
individual game.

GET /games/four-up/matches/1/moves

{
    "moves": [
        {
            "player": "kevinburke",
            "move": 2
        }
    ]
}

### Create a Game

First, invite a player to play with you.

1. POST /players/<username>/invitations

You must include a Game parameter (with the name of the game to play) when
making a POST request. You *may* include a `FirstMove` parameter which
establishes the first move. This can be either of the invited players, or the
word `random`, in which case the computer will choose the first player at
random. If you don't provide a parameter, we'll choose the first player at
random.

When the server receives your POST request, it will make a request to the
player's InviteUrl with the details of the game. If the player responds with a
200 OK, the game is on.

If the other player accepts your invitation, the API will respond with 201
Created, and details about the created game.

##### Example

POST /players/kyleconroy/invitations HTTP/1.0
Host: api.battleofbits.com
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{"Game": "four-up", "FirstMove": "kyleconroy"}

HTTP/1.0 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 5,
    "red_player": "kyleconroy",
    "black_player": "kevinburke",
    "started": "2013",
    "finished": null,
    "winner": null,
    "board": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}

### During the Match

When it's your turn, our server will make an HTTP request to your MovesUrl. You
have 30 seconds to respond with a valid move. A valid move changes per game,
but here is an example for four-up:

#### Our server's outgoing request

POST /user/four-up/MovesUrl HTTP/1.0
Host: yourserver.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
    "board": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
}

#### Your response

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "move": 3
}

### Ending the Match

A match ends if any of the following conditions are true:

- Your server does not send a complete response within 30 seconds.
- Your server responds with a 4xx or 5xx status code.
- Your server does not respond with a valid move.
- Your move is invalid (for example, in connect four, imagine trying to make
  a move in a column that is already full)
- You make a move that either wins the game or loses the game.

When the game ends, we'll make one final request to your webhook url, with
information about the game winner and the current state of the board.

In the case of a forfeit or a server malfunction, we'll also make a request to
the ErrorUrl for both players, with details about the error.
